<h1>Reminders:</h1>

<p>There is very limited cell phone coverage at camp. If you need to contact your child in an emergency and you cannot reach them via their mobile phone, please contact the school during school hours or Camp Wainui after hours on (04) 564 5305. There are not an abundance of powerpoints for students to charge their phones while away. I would advise them to either have a power bank or, even better, turn their phone to aeroplane mode while at camp to preserve battery and then turn it back on when they arrive back at school if they need to contact you for a lift home, etc. They should not be on their devices while away.<br>

<br>In the permission slip, carers agreed that they would discuss with their child the rules of camp. These include no alcohol, vaping, smoking, drugs, or following the rules at all times. If students are found to break these rules, then you will be called to come and pick them up, and there may be further consequences at school. Once it 'lights out' in the evening, all students must stay in their own tents.<br>

<br>If you have not yet paid, please do so immediately. If payment is a problem, please let me know. The total cost for the four days is $80. If you have a personalised programme due to injuries, etc., please contact the school office, and they will advise you on how much you need to pay. If you wish to pay via internet banking, please use the following:<br>
	
<br>Details are at Tawa College, 123192-0011938-00. Please include 'Calitz, Joshua' and 'EOTC' in the reference box.<br>

<br>As a reminder, students need to bring their own packed lunches for both days. Please ensure your son or daughter has enough food to sustain them on the 10-kilometre walk and for the activities at camp. Water bottles can be refilled from the camp taps.<br>

<br>GEAR LIST FOR CAMP:<br>

<br>1. In your day pack, you should have:
lunch, a water bottle, a sun hat, sunscreen, a warm jumper or thermal, and a rain jacket. Any personal medication. Please label your day pack with your name and form of class.<br>

<br>2. In your overnight bag, you should have:
Pyjamas, a torch, a sleeping bag, a full change of warm clothes, a warm hat, a small towel, and togs if you wish to go in the lagoon for raft building. Toothbrush and toothpaste. Your packed lunch for the second day, a roll mat or inflatable mattress (highly recommended, but you will cope without one). Any medication or sanitary items you may require. Please name your bag clearly with your name and form class.<br>

<br>Optional items: pillowcase (that you can stuff with clothes to use as a pillow), snacks for nighttime, a sports ball or playing cards, etc. for evening entertainment, insect repellent, slides, or jandals for the evening. Please leave speakers for music at home.<br>

<br>Tents and sleeping bags: if your family can provide a tent and/or spare sleeping bags, please label them clearly with your name and form class. Parents, I would advise you to check how many tent pegs, etc. there are so that your son or daughter gets them all back in.<br>

<br>I will be at the camps for the next four days, with limited reception and access to emails.<br>

<br>If there are any problems during that time, please contact the school office.<br></p>
